## Redis & Laravel Example

In the Socket.io demo, the real time update capablities of socket were showcased, but here, the focus turns to the backend framework.
In this system, rather than using a service like Pusher, the neckbeard in me wants to build it from the ground up.
Thanks to Jeffrey Way's Socket series, this project does just that.

Enjoy!
